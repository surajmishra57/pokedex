/**
 * Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k,
 * determine whether there exist two indices i and j such that arr[i] == arr[j] and |i – j| ≤ k.
 * If such a pair exists, return ‘Yes’, otherwise return ‘No’.
 *
 *
 * Input: k = 3, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 * Output: No
 * Explanation: Each element in the given array arr[] appears twice and the distance between every element and its duplicate is 4.
 *
 * Input: k = 3, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
 * Output: Yes
 * Explanation: 1 is present at index 0 and 3.
 *
 * Input: k = 3, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * Output: No
 * Explanation: There is no duplicate element in arr[].
