/**
 * Given an array of n integers, find the 3 elements such that a[i] < a[j] < a[k] and i < j < k in 0(n) time.
 * If there are multiple such triplets, then print any one of them.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {12, 11, 10, 5, 6, 2, 30}
 * Output: 5, 6, 30
 * Explanation: As 5 < 6 < 30, and they
 * appear in the same sequence in the array
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
 * Output: 1, 2, 3 OR 1, 2, 4 OR 2, 3, 4
 * Explanation: As the array is sorted, for every i, j, k,
 * where i < j < k, arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k]
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 1}
 * Output: No such triplet exists.
